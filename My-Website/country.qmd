title: "Country Analysis: Mexico"
---


In this analysis, we will explore the changes in life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population in Mexico over time using the Gapminder dataset, ggplot, and dplyr. The following plot 

```{r}
# Load the necessary packages and data
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter data for the United States
mx_data <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Mexico")


# plot for life expectancy over time
ggplot(mx_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Life Expectancy in Mexico Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Life Expectancy") 
```
