In this analysis, we will explore the relationship between life expectancy and population using the Gapminder dataset and ggplot.

```{r}
# Load the necessary packages and data
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

# Plot showing Life Expectancy vs Population
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Life Expectancy and Population",
    x = "Population",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  ) +
  scale_x_log10()  # Log scale for population
```
