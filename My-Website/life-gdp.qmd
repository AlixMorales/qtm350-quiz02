title: "Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita"
---

In this analysis, we will explore the relationship between life expectancy
and GDP per capita using the Gapminder dataset and ggplot. 

```{r}
# Loading the Gapminder package and data
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

# Create the plot showing Life Expectancy vs GDP per capita
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  # Add closing parenthesis here
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale for GDP per capita (smooths out plot)
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita",
    x = "GDP per Capita",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  )
```
